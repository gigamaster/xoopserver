## Introduction

Design a web application, and a web site, requires you to take the jump from client-side technologies like HTML/CSS/Javascript, to server-side technologies like PHP. In order to successfully develop in this language, you need the ability to test your work before you launch it into the public domain of the Internet. You have to set up your own web server on your local PC, using freely downloadable software. The combination to work with Apache, MySQL and PHP allows development and testing on a local machine without the concerns of a consistent Internet connection.
